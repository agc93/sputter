# Sputter CLI (aka `Sputter.Console`)

This project is the command-line interface (CLI) for Sputter. You can use this CLI to quickly check the temperatures of drives from any of Sputter's [supported adapters](https://agc93.github.io/sputter/docs/reference/adapters/).

You can find a quick start guide to quickly get you up and running with the Sputter CLI [here](https://agc93.github.io/sputter/docs/quickstart/#command-line-interface-cli) or more details on the CLI and how to use it [in the CLI docs](https://agc93.github.io/sputter/docs/command-line/).

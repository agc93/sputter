Once enabled, any time Sputter publishes measurements (after requests, or on a schedule) you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to immediately see updated values right in Home Assistant.
Configuration linkTo enable the Home Assistant support, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to first set up MQTT support.
⚠ If you don&amp;rsquo;t have MQTT configured correctly, the HA integration will not work!</description></item><item><title>Home Assistant Add-on</title><link>/docs/server/home-assistant/addon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 16:13:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/server/home-assistant/addon/</guid><description>⚠ The Home Assistant add-on is in extremely early preview and has not been tested much. Use with caution! We provide a Home Assistant add-on for running Sputter inside supported Home Assistant installations.
This is particularly useful when you are running Home Assistant on the same hardware as the drives you&amp;rsquo;re trying to monitor, or when using the Scrutiny integration.
Installation linkFrom the Settings &amp;gt; Add-ons &amp;gt; Add-on Store menu, click the overflow menu in the top-right, choose Repositories and add https://github.</description></item></channel></rss>

configuration:
  broker:
    name: MQTT Broker
    description: >-
      The address of your MQTT broker server. If you do not specify a server here, Sputter will not publish temperatures over MQTT.
  userName:
    name: MQTT User Name
    description: >-
      Optional user name if your MQTT server uses authentication
  password:
    name: MQTT Password
    description: >-
      Optional password if your MQTT server uses authentication
  port:
    name: MQTT Port
    description: >-
      Port used to connect to your MQTT Server
  autoMeasureInterval:
    name: Automatic Measurement Interval
    description: >-
      Interval (in seconds) between automatically grabbing measurements. If you don't specify an interval here, Sputter will only measure your drives on-demand.
  scrutinyApiAddress:
    name: Scrutiny API Address
    description: >-
      Optional address of a running Scrutiny server instance to gather drive temperatures from. Must be a full URL, such as https://scrutiny.mydomain.io/api/ or http://192.168.0.100:8080/api/
  singleDeviceMode:
    name: Single Device Mode
    description: >-
      By default (if you have MQTT enabled), Sputter will create a device in Home Assistant for each monitored drive. If you turn this on, it will instead create a single "Sputter" device and add all the drive sensors to that one device.
  deviceArea:
    name: Device Area
    description: >-
      The default area for devices created in Home Assistant. Optional.
  expireAfter:
    name: Expire Sensor Data After
    description: >-
      Optionally expire sensor data after this many seconds. This can lead to unexpected "Unavailable" states, but makes it more obvious when sensor data stops being received.
  enableAllDrives:
    name: Allow Publishing All Drives
    description: >-
      By default, Sputter will only publish drive sensors to Home Assistant if you have configured drive filters to prevent "overloading" HA with a lot of drives. If you enable this, Sputter will add devices for all discovered drives to HA even without any filters.
  enableAllSensors:
    name: Enable All Drive Sensors
    description: >-
      By default, only temperature sensors are enabled when added to Home Assistant (rather than added, but disabled by default). Enable this to enable all discovered sensors.
  driveTemplates:
    name: Drive Filters
    description: >-
      Filters to match against discovered drives. Only drives that match these filters will be published over MQTT.
